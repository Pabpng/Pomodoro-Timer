Pomodoro-Timer Desktop App Timeline

Basic Functions:
- Configurable Timer Intervals: Set the duration for study intervals with the most common being "25 minutes" with "5 minute" breaks.

- Notification/System Alarms: An audible and visual queue to let the user know that their study session has been completed.

- Tracking System: The application should track the progress of the user, such as the amount of time that has been studied and the breaks that have been taken.

- Indicator for long breaks: Every three-four Pomodoro's, there should be a key indication of a well-deserved long break around "15 minutes" to "30 minutes".

- Pause and Stop Functionality: The app should grant the user the ability to pause the timer when a distraction occurs.

Design:
- Interface: The design should be clean and doesn't pose much of a distraction.

- Artistic Direction: The Pomodoro app should have a unique look with some minimal animations, which indicates progression.
